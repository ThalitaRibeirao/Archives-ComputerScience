# Description
<p>Have you ever wondered what a Computer Science student at USP studies?</p>
<p>To answer this question, I decided to create this repository. In each folder, I'll find some archives used </b> at USP Ribeir√£o.</p>

# About the grade

## Introduction to Computing I (Semester I)

### Technologies used
- C

## Introduction to Computing II (Semester II)
<p>Discipline focused on deepening knowledge in the C language and algorithms. You can find some study materials <a href="https://github.com/ThalitaRibeirao/Arquivos_Segundo_Semestre/tree/main/Materiais%20ICII">here</a>.</p>

### Technologies used
- C
- C++

## Languages and Programming Paradigms (Semester II)
<p>Every programming language has a paradigm, meaning the way the language is structured. In this discipline, new paradigms such as <b>Object-oriented Languages</b> and <b>Logical Languages</b> will be presented. You can find study materials <a href="https://github.com/ThalitaRibeirao/Arquivos_Segundo_Semestre/tree/main/Materiais%20LPP">here</a>, based on Deitel (8th edition).</p>
